/// Stores information for every ink! trait message of an ink! trait definition.
///
/// This information includes if the ink! trait message is payable
/// as well as its derived or manually specified selector.
///
/// In the future this info trait might be extended to contain
/// more information about a single ink! trait message.
///
/// The information provided through this trait can be used on the
/// implementer side of an ink! trait to check and guard certain
/// properties on a Rust type system level. This is important since
/// ink! cannot be guaranteed to have both the ink! trait definition
/// and all of its implementers under its scope and radar.
///
/// # Note
///
/// - The `TraitMessageInfo<LOCAL_ID>` is implemented by the automatically generated ink!
///   trait definition information object associated to the ink! trait definition at hand.
/// - For every ink! trait message defined by the ink! trait definition the associated
///   ink! trait definition information object implements this trait given the
///   `TRAIT_LOCAL_MESSAGE_ID` of each ink! trait message respectively.
/// - The local IDs uniquely identifying all the ink! trait messages of the ink! trait
///   definition are computed solely using the Rust identifier of the ink! trait message
///   which can be derived from ink! implementation blocks in order to query the
///   information stored by this ink! trait information object trait implementation.
