/// # Usage
///
/// A smart contract that has too few funds to pay for its storage fees
/// can eventually be evicted. An evicted smart contract `C` leaves behind
/// a tombstone associated with a hash that has been computed partially
/// by its storage contents.
///
/// To restore contract `C` back to a fully working contract the normal
/// process is to write another contract `C2` with the only purpose to
/// eventually have the absolutely same contract storage as `C` did when
/// it was evicted.
/// For that purpose `C2` can use other storage keys that have not been in
/// use by contract `C`.
/// Once `C2` contract storage matches the storage of `C` when it was evicted
/// `C2` can invoke this method in order to initiate restoration of `C`.
/// A tombstone hash is calculated for `C2` and if it matches the tombstone
/// hash of `C` the restoration is going to be successful.
/// The `filtered_keys` argument can be used to ignore the extraneous keys
/// used by `C2` but not used by `C`.
///
/// The process of such a smart contract restoration can generally be very expensive.
///

///
/// - The `filtered_keys` can be used to ignore certain storage regions
///   in the restorer contract to not influence the hash calculations.
/// - Does *not* perform restoration right away but defers it to the end of
///   the contract execution.
/// - Restoration is cancelled if there is no tombstone in the destination
///   address or if the hashes don't match. No changes are made in this case.
