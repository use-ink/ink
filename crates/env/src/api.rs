/// 1. The storage at the code hash will remain untouched.
///
/// Contract developers **must ensure** that the storage layout of the new code is
/// compatible with that of the old code.
///
/// 2. The contract address (`AccountId`) remains the same, while the `code_hash` changes.
///
/// Contract addresses are initially derived from `hash(deploying_address ++ code_hash ++
/// salt)`. This makes it possible to determine a contracts address (`AccountId`) using
/// the `code_hash` of the *initial* code used to instantiate the contract.
///
/// However, because `set_code_hash` can modify the underlying `code_hash` of a contract,
/// it should not be relied upon that a contracts address can always be derived from its
/// stored `code_hash`.
///
/// 3. Re-entrant calls use new `code_hash`.
///
/// If a contract calls into itself after changing its code the new call would use the new
/// code. However, if the original caller panics after returning from the sub call it
/// would revert the changes made by `set_code_hash` and the next caller would use the old
/// code.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// todo: this enum variant no longer exists
/// `ReturnCode::CodeNotFound` in case the supplied `code_hash` cannot be found on-chain.
///
/// # Storage Compatibility
///
/// When the smart contract code is modified,
/// it is important to observe an additional virtual restriction
/// that is imposed on this procedure:
/// you should not change the order in which the contract state variables
/// are declared, nor their type.
///
/// Violating the restriction will not prevent a successful compilation,
/// but will result in the mix-up of values or failure to read the storage correctly.
/// This can result in severe errors in the application utilizing the contract.
///
/// If the storage of your contract looks like this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[ink(storage)]
/// pub struct YourContract {
///     x: u32,
///     y: bool,
/// }
/// ```
///
