/// # Note
///
/// This trait is automatically implemented for ink! message and constructor decoders.

/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if any of the decode steps failed:
///
/// - `InvalidSelector`: The first four bytes could not properly decoded into the
///   selector.
/// - `UnknownSelector`: The decoded selector did not match any of the expected ones.
/// - `InvalidParameters`: Failed to decoded the parameters for the selected dispatchable.
///
/// The other dispatch errors are handled by other structures usually.

/// # Usage
///
/// todo: prev doc test used a contract instance, it was in the `ink!` crate.
