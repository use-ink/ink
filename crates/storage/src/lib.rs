//! The `ink_storage` utilities used to manipulate and organize contract storage.
//!
//! Mainly provides entities to work on a contract's storage
//! as well as high-level collections on top of those.
//! Also provides environmental utilities, such as storage allocators,
//! FFI to interface with FRAME contracts and a primitive blockchain
//! emulator for simple off-chain testing.
