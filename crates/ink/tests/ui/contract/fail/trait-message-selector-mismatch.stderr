  = note: expected values for `feature` are: `default`, `ink-debug`, `no-allocator`, `no-panic-handler`, `scale-info`, `show-codegen-docs`, `std`, and `test_instantiate`
  = note: using a cfg inside a attribute macro will use the cfgs from the destination crate and not the ones from the defining crate
  = help: try referring to `ink::contract` crate for guidance on how handle this unexpected cfg
  = help: the attribute macro `ink::contract` may come from an old version of the `ink_macro` crate, try updating your dependency with `cargo update -p ink_macro`
  = note: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/check-cfg/cargo-specifics.html> for more information about checking conditional configuration
  = note: `#[warn(unexpected_cfgs)]` on by default
  = note: this warning originates in the attribute macro `ink::contract` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
