note: if you're trying to build a new `contract::Contract` consider using one of the following associated functions:
      contract::_::<impl contract::Contract>::constructor
      contract::Contract::constructor_impl

   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
help: trait `StaticEnv` which provides `env` is implemented but not in scope; perhaps you want to import it
