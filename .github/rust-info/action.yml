        # TODO: The installation of `cargo-contract` here can be removed after
        # a new image of https://hub.docker.com/r/paritytech/ci-unified/tags has
        # been published. At the time of this commit the Docker image is from
        # Sep 11, 2024. This means that the `cargo-contract` binary in the image
        # is also that old. There was a bug with `cargo-contract` erring on
        # newer Rust versions (https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/pull/1786),
        # hence we make sure to use the latest `cargo-contract` here.
