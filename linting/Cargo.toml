# For the moment we have to include the tests as examples and
# then use `dylint_testing::ui_test_examples`.
#
# The reason is that the `dylint_testing` API currently does not
# provide any other option to run the tests on those files
# *while giving us the option to specify the dependencies*.
#
# Those files require the ink! dependencies though, by having
# them as examples here, they inherit the `dev-dependencies`.
