#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

//! Demonstrates how to use [`set_code_hash`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/latest/ink_env/fn.set_code_hash.html)
//! to swap out the `code_hash` of an on-chain contract.
//!
//! We will swap the code of our `Incrementer` contract with that of the `Incrementer`
//! found in the `updated_incrementer` folder.
//!
//! See the included End-to-End tests an example update workflow.
