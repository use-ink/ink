//! # The Mother of All Contracts
//!
//! This contract is intended to make use of all features that are observable
//! by off-chain tooling (for example user interfaces).
//! It doesn't do anything useful beyond serving off-chain tooling developers
//! with a contract to test their software against.
//!
//! Currently, this includes the following:
//!
//!   1. Use complex nested input and output types. This is done with the use case of a
//!      data structure needed to store data of a candle auction.
//!   2. Make contract fail with `ContractTrapped`.
//!   3. Make contract fail with returning an `Error`.
//!   4. Perform debug printing from contract into the node's log.
//!   5. Use complex types in storage.
