# Reporting a vulnerability

If you find something that can be treated as a security vulnerability, please do not use the issue tracker or discuss it in the public forum/channels, as it can cause more damage rather than giving real help to the ecosystem.

Security vulnerabilities should be reported using [this contact form](https://blocksurvey.io/ink-security-vulnerability-reporting-QCfzqPF8QMqIrJUEll7yPA?v=o).
